## Introduction
The Chest X-Ray Detection Project aims to develop a deep learning model to detect various chest-related abnormalities from X-ray images. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify and localize different conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and more.

## Dataset
We use the [Chest X-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) available on Kaggle. The dataset contains X-ray images categorized into normal and abnormal (pneumonia) classes.

### Dataset Structure
```

```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chest-xray-detection.git
    cd chest-xray-detection
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `dataset` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
3. To train the model, run:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
4. To evaluate the model on the test set, run:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## Model Training
The `train.py` script is used to train the model. It includes various parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc. You can modify these parameters in the script or pass them as command-line arguments.

Example:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

## Evaluation
The `evaluate.py` script evaluates the trained model on the test dataset and prints out metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
After training and evaluation, the results including the trained model, logs, and evaluation metrics will be saved in the `results` directory. You can visualize the training process and evaluation metrics using the saved logs.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
